Axios has become the go to use http library for javascript.
Under the hood axios uses <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest'>XMLHttpRequest</a> for browser environment and <a href='http://nodejs.org/api/http.html'>
http</a> for nodejs to make http network request.

While this all works perfectly it fails to work in service worker.
With chromium enforcing manifest version 3 for extension, Background pages are replaced by service workers.
So use of axios in service worker is not possible. To overcome this
you can pass custom adapter to axios to override XMLHttpRequest/http.

In this case we can use fetch api to make http request. There is an NPM package [`@vespaiach/axios-fetch-adapter`](google.com)
which is a fetch adapter for axios.

```js
npm install @vespaiach/axios-fetch-adapter
```

Then add it to axios config.

```js
import fetchAdapter from '@vespaiach/axios-fetch-adapter';
const instance = axios.create({
  adapter: fetchAdapter
  ....
});
```

Voila! it works!
